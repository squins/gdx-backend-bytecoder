# LibGDX Bytecoder backend
Support any libgdx project with any JVM language (Kotlin, Groovy, Scala) on the web!

We have a working [demo] available, and are working hard to make it work for most libGDX apps out of the box!

## About The Project

We are making a libGDX backend to run any libgdx app (whether written in Java or another JVM language) on the web using WebAssembly or JavaScript.  
Bytecoder transpiles byte code to wasm32 or js. 

The status is that a simple libgdx app now can run on the web! See our [demo].

### Built With

* [Libgdx]
* [Kotlin]
* [Bytecoder]

### Testing JavaScript APIs

We are testing JavaScript apis in the [web-demo] project. Audio and Webgl are now ready, in future things like keyboard, mouse interaction when we implement them in Libgdx.

Having a dedicated project to test those apis, makes the Bytecoder backend implementation just dedicated to porting the JS calls to Kotlin.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Installation

Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/squins/gdx-backend-bytecoder.git
```
#### Libgdx sample app (gradle)

The sample app contains all libgdx features that have been port. JAR files are provided to Bytecoder maven project
using local Maven repo.

Steps to build:

```sh
cd libgdx-sample-app
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```
#### Which backend to use
The sample app supports js and wasm.

This can be set in the properties of the `gdx-backend-bytecoder-example` `pom`:

    <bytecoder-mavenplugin.backend>
    
with 1 of these properties: `js` or `wasm_llvm`, default on `js`.

#### Gdx-backend-bytecoder project (root path)
Build project

    mvn clean install -DskipTests

### Run the sample app

Start a webserver in `target/bytecoder`. We assume port 8096 is used. Content type for `.wasm` files must be `application/wasm` and for `.js` files, `text/javascript`.

Go to <http://localhost:8096>

Click the 'Play' button to start the app. When you press it, you will see a red square and hear some music. 
This comes from the libGDX game written in Kotlin.
